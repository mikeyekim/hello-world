hey how's it going? just initializing a couple of notes here.
planning on finishing up python soon. next, we will try to tackle
ruby and mySQL. hopefully we can ease into a comfortable schedule
and get in the habit of practicing code almost every day

as with many things in life, we should take it slow and not rush into this
in the same way as someone who just discovered their love for running,
diving in straight into a marathon.
